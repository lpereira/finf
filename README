FINF Is Not Forth

FINF is a simple implementation for a FORTH-like language for the Arduino platform. It is free software, released under GNU GPL version 2.

Current version weighs about 5kB of object code, making it suitable even for less beefier Arduinos, such as the ones based on the Atmega168 microcontrollers.

Aside from a *very* limited word library, FINF does not yet support "if..else..then" blocks, nor "repeat..until" blocks. Code comments are not supported either.

Please fork it and help improve it! :)
